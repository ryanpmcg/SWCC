# Robert’s Rules of Order: A Quick Guide

## What It Is
Robert’s Rules is a set of guidelines to run meetings smoothly, fairly, and efficiently. It helps ensure everyone gets a chance to speak, decisions are made democratically, and chaos is avoided. Here’s the basics for your club.

## 1. Prep Before the Meeting
- **Agenda:** The president or leader makes a simple agenda (e.g., welcome, old business, new business, announcements, adjourn). Share it with members ahead of time if possible.
- **Roles:** You’ll need a president/chair to lead, a secretary to take notes, and maybe a treasurer for budget updates.

## 2. Starting the Meeting
- **Call to Order:** The president says, “The meeting is called to order,” when it’s time to start (usually when most people are there).
- **Minutes:** The secretary reads or shares a summary of the last meeting’s notes. Someone says, “I move to approve the minutes,” another says, “Second,” and the group votes (usually just a quick “aye” or “nay”).

## 3. How to Discuss Stuff
- **Motions:** To bring up an idea, a member says, “I move that [idea].” Another says, “I second it.” If no second, it drops. 
- **Debate:** The president lets people speak (one at a time). Raise your hand or wait to be recognized. Keep it respectful and on topic.
- **Amendments:** Want to tweak the idea? Say, “I move to amend by [change].” It needs a second, then debate and a vote.
- **Ending Debate:** When ready, someone says, “I move to call the question” (meaning “let’s vote now”). Needs a second and a 2/3 vote to stop talking.

## 4. Voting
- **The president says:** “All in favor say ‘aye,’ all opposed say ‘nay.’” Or use a hand raise if it’s close.
- **Majority Wins:** Usually, more than half the votes decides it. Tie? The motion fails unless the president breaks it.

## 5. Key Rules to Keep It Fair
- **One Speaker at a Time:** No interrupting. Wait your turn.
- **Stay on Topic:** Stick to the motion being discussed.
- **Equal Rights:** Every member gets a say and a vote (if they’re dues-paying or whatever your club requires).

## 6. Wrapping Up
- **Adjournment:** When done, someone says, “I move to adjourn.” Seconded, voted, and you’re out!

## Tips for Your Club
- Keep it simple—don’t overcomplicate things with fancy terms.
- The president can say “Let’s keep this informal” for small stuff, but use the process for big decisions (like spending money or changing rules).
- Practice makes it faster—don’t stress if it’s clunky at first.
